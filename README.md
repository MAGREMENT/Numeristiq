# SudokuSolver

A program that solves Sudoku's for you !

## Description

This application allows you to enter a specifi Sudoku that you'd like to solve an follow step by step the different strategies used to resolve it.
Theses steps are saved as "logs" that you can go back to. They show you the state of the sudoku before the step, after and highlights the board
with the different elements of the strategy. There is also an explanation for each step in the text block below but that is WIP for now. 
All the strategies currently in use are also shown and it is possible to toggle them ON/Off.

Everything is written in C# with dotnet 6.0 and the visuals are done with WPF.

## Features I hope to implement

- Always more strategies
- A new UI look (but I need to learn more about wpf for now)
- A player
- Maybe a generator later in the future

## How to install

To use and modify this project, you'll need dotnet 6.0 on windows
