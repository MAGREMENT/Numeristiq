An aligned pair exclusion is the removal of candidate(s) using the following logic : Any two cells cannot have solutions that are candidates contained in an almost locked set they both see.

Let's take these two boxes as an example where r45c1 is the target. There are 3 ways to make 5 fit into r4c1 : 

    5 4 -> Impossible because of r56c3
    5 8 -> Impossible because of r12c1
    5 9 -> Impossible because of r12c1

We can therefore safely remove 5 from r4c1
